# rillNetwork

This repository contains codes used in Doane, T.H., Pelletier, J.D, and M.H. Nichols, (2020) "How Hack distributions of rill networks contribute to nonlinear slope length-soil loss relationships". 

dInfRoute2.py is a python code that contains a number of subroutines that [1] generate a surface with a Scheidegger network and [2] route flow down a surface.
This code generates Figures (11) and (12) and the results form the basis of Figure (13).

aSample.py performs inverse transform sampling for the distribution of contributing area and then applies deterministic relationships to obtain distributions
of hydraulic variables. Figure (9) is generated from this code.
